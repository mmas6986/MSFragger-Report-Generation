# MSFragger-Report-Generation
Takes the MSFragger MSStats output, consolidates it into a Report and generates figures.
Lots of problems in this code, and much has to be changed from project to project, but it's a start to a totally automated data analysis pipeline.
A very very early start with a long way to go.
